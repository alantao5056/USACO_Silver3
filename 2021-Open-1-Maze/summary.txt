this is obviously a flood fill problem, but actually finding the number of ways that we can win is tedious. I first thought that this was essentially a graph, but that idea would get too complicated, and it would be just as hard. The solution then turns out to be finding all the possible ways to play the game, but keeping track of the visited array is not simply just true or false, it's about keeping track of the board positions that we currently have when we stepped on that cell. This it still pretty tedious to write, but this is the only solution. (P.S. the grid is represented as a 9 digit trinary number, with '.' = 0, 'M' = 1, 'O' = 2)
