this problem is a greedy problem, however getting the idea for the greedy solution and proving/convincing yourself that it actually work is hard. We can use greedy, and give every cell that's empty the closest cow that can get to it. We can then keep going and do this until there's one cow in every cell. However, we would need to try every possible point in the barn to see which would work.
