This problem might seem insanely hard at first, but after knowing to do binary search, we can make 
this problem much simpler. We can binary search the minimum width of the wormholes, and then seeing 
if the cows would sort themselves. To do that, we need to dfs the wormholes having more than or equal 
to the minimum width, and figure out if they are connected so that the cows can go where they need to 
be. (reminder: the usaco grading site might be unstable, and mark a few cases to be time out, but 
actually, submitting it several times it might not be time out again)
